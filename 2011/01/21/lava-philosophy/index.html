  <h1>Lava Philosophy</h1>
  <p>There has been an entertaing debate in the philosophical blogosphere recently and the battle is ones again between object-oriented philosophy and it's discontents.</p>

<p>Tim Morton <a href="http://ecologywithoutnature.blogspot.com/search/label/lava%20lamp%20materialism">accuses</a> process philosophy --- philosophy that hilights flows, change, mutation over fully formed objects -- for being "lava-lamp philosophy". He claims that the ontology of process philosophy is really just an aesthetics that likes flowing stuff...like in a lava lamp. Further he claims that process philosophy (basically he means Deleuzians) are like lava lamps because the flowy things happen within a world, on a body without organs. This can either be a primordial chaos-soup or basically linear time. He compares this to house music where lots of layered rythms and sounds happen on top of four-to-the-floor beat. It's flows but that doesn't change anything. Flow within a body of statis. Liek a lava lamp.</p>

<p>I have illustrated this with this drawing:</p>

<p><img src="/img/lava.jpg" alt="lava" /></p>

<p>Now imagine the lines constantly shifting within the square, changing the shapes. Kind of lava-lampish, isn't it? The idea of a <em>World</em> is one of Mortons targets and object-oriented philosophy in his version replaces the world with individual objects. Time is something that happens within and between objects, not on a horizon within a world.</p>

<p>The objects are fully formed, autonomous and never come into direct contact. I illustrated ny extending the first drawing in this way:</p>

<p><img src="/img/ooo.jpg" alt="ooo" /></p>

<p>Now I couldn't resist drawing a third drawing illustrating my unfinished ontology of kvasi object oriented philosophy --- or KOOP for short --- where neither world nor objects are ontologized:</p>

<p><img src="/img/koop.jpg" alt="koop" /></p>

<p>So, lava lamp philosophy is body (the square) without organs, object-oriented philosophy is fully formed organs without body (no world) and I have organ-bodies, some kind of mutant-cyborg-zombie thing going on there...</p>

<p>Lava lamp philosophy has relations of interiority, all change happen within the world. OOO has relations of exteriority change happen (within and) between individual objects. I have relations of xenoteriority, my organ-bodies giving birth to slimy aliens and parasites growing out of their foreheads.</p>

<p>Finally, change in KOOP is contingent, borrowed from Meillasoux, in the sense that both objects and worlds could arise at any time...who knows. At least it's a very nice symbol.</p>
