  <h1>Notes on Networks</h1>
  <p><span><span></span></span><span></span><span><span>1)When people meet a stranger on the other side of the world and they find out that they have some common acquaintance, the reaction is usually one of surprise about the meeting</span></span>."What a coincidence that we had this acquaintance!"<br /><div><span><span>   <br />   </span></span><span><span>But the remarkable thing is not that they had an common acquaintance with a complete stranger on the other side of the world, </span></span><span><span>since the average distance between any two persons are only about three links. </span></span><span><span>The remarkable thing is that they managed to find this connection in the brief moment that they conversed. </span></span><span><span>Thus, it is a miracle of communication and not one of a cosmic coincidence. </span></span><span><span><br />   </span></span><span><span><br />   2) The seduction of networks is their nearness, bringing near what is far while preserving its farness. To be close friends is to be near, to share a world. To network is to believe in the nearness of that which is far away, in a separate world.<br />   </span></span><br />   <span><span>3)</span></span><span><span></span></span><span>  </span><span><span>Our acquaintances are more "useful" in our lives than close friends.</span></span><span></span><span><span> Important in the sense of helping you find a job, pick up gossip, get news and so on. This is b</span></span><span><span>ecause your close friends probably all know each other</span></span><span></span><span><span>, but with each new acquaintance you get access to a new network of friends.</span></span>   </div> <br /> <br /></p>
